// JavaScript Data types are used to identify the type of data that is stored inside a
// variable during the script execution.
// So JavaScript data types are basically for identification purposes to know what is
// being stored in the variable, when it's stored, not before that.
//Variable names should start with a letter and it should have no spaces.
//Variable names are case-sensitive hence var name and var Name are completely different variables.
// There are three types of variables:
//Strings
var str= "Web Program"

//Booleans
var isOn= true;

//Numbers
var age=25;
